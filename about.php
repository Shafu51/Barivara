					<h2>বাড়িভাড়া</h2>
					<p>Today, the Internet is a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Life has become easier as a result of using the internet. The internet is used to solve any problem. So, we are going to create a project which people can easily get a good quality house rent according to their ability or requirement by using internet. Because in Bangladesh it has become a big problem to find a quality full house for rent. We are going to create a web-based application “Barivara (বাড়িভাড়া) " that will help to easily find house for rent. To find a suitable house rents, flat rents, seat rents or sublet rents. Advertisers can post their house/flat rents and students can post seat rents as well. It will give all kinds of information about the house so that anyone can rent the desired house and get the necessary conversations, transactions and interactions by phone. This will reduce the workload, save time and easily see the available house list.
                    To solve all these problems, we want to create the (বাড়িভাড়া) website. If you are looking for home rents search for your desired rents by location, number of bed room(s), number of wash room(s), rent price and many more advanced in our website.
